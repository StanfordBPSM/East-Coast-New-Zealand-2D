# East Coast New Zealand 2D
 
The East Coast Basin (ECB) of the North Island, New Zealand contains active petroleum systems and has been explored intermittently since the late 1800s. Despite a few small discoveries, the basin is non-commercial largely due to stratigraphic and structural complexities associated with its development on the Hikurangi convergent margin. The major petroleum system risks are the presence of reservoir rock and good potential, mature source rock. Additionally, high overpressures have caused significant drilling problems, representing both a financial burden and a safety hazard for exploration. This model was used in Dr. Blair Burgeen-Chan's dissertation to investigate the petroleum system elements and processes of the ECB, and understand the importance of convergent margin structure on reservoir architecture, overpressure generation and distribution, and source rock maturation.

Hydrocarbon summary map of the East Coast Basin, New Zealand. The CM05-01 seismic line is the location of the two-dimensional BPSM presented in this study. Seep
sites are based on locations from Hollis et al. (2005) and references therein. Well locations and well description are from the web-based Petroleum Basin Explorer (Scadden et al., 2013 and references therein). Miocene seep site locations are from Campbell et al. (2008) and Cretaceous seep site locations are from Kiel et al. (2013). Digital elevation map is from NIWA (2008).

Stratigraphy of the present day 2D basin and petroleum system model for seismic line CM05-01 in Hawke Bay. The transect is sub-divided by a red dashed line into four structural sections: Inboard, Lachlan Basin, Lachlan Footwall, and Outboard. LR = Lachlan ridge.
