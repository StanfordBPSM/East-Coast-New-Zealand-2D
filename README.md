# East Coast New Zealand 2D
 
The East Coast Basin (ECB) of the North Island, New Zealand contains active petroleum systems and has been explored intermittently since the late 1800s. Despite a few small discoveries, the basin is non-commercial largely due to stratigraphic and structural complexities associated with its development on the Hikurangi convergent margin. The major petroleum system risks are the presence of reservoir rock and good potential, mature source rock. Additionally, high overpressures have caused significant drilling problems, representing both a financial burden and a safety hazard for exploration. This model was used in Dr. Blair Burgeen-Chan's dissertation to investigate the petroleum system elements and processes of the ECB, and understand the importance of convergent margin structure on reservoir architecture, overpressure generation and distribution, and source rock maturation.
